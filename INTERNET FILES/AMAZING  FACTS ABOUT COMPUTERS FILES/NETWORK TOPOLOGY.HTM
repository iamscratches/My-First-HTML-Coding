TOPOLOGY REFERS TO THE ARRANGEMENT OF COMPUTER NETWORKS.<BR>
COMPUTER NETWORKS MAY BE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE ARRANGEMENT OF NODES OF A NETWORK.THERE ARE VARIOUS TYPES OF
TOPOLOGIES SUCH AS <FONT COLOR=VIOLET>RING,MESH,BUS,STAR OR TREE</FONT>
 
<H4><HEAD>STAR TOPOLOGY</HEAD></H4><IMG SRC="S.BMP" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER=3 HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=100>
IN STAR NETWORK ALL THE COMPUTERS ARE CONNECTED TO CENTRAL DEVICE KNOWN AS <FONT COLOR=VIOLET>SERVER</FONT>.THE SERVER CONTROLS ALL
THE FUNCTIONS OF THE NETWORK.ANY INFORMATIONS WHICH HAS TO BE TRANSFERRED FROM ONE COMPUTER TO ANOTHER HAS 
TO GO THROUGH THE SERVER MACHINE.THIS KIND OF TOPOLOGY IS EASY TO INSTALL,BUT IF THE SERVER FAILS,THE NETWORK
IS DISABLED.THE SERVER USES A DEVICE CALLED THE"HUB"TO CONNECT ALL THE COMPUTERS IN A NETWORK.<BR>

<H4><HEAD>RING TOPOLOGY</HEAD></H4><IMG SRC="O.BMP" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER=3 HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=100>
IN RING TOPOLOGY ALL THE COMPUTERS OTHER DEVICES ARE CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER IN A CLOSED CIRCLE.THERE IS NO CENTRAL
SERVER MACHINE.INSTEAD EACH MACHINE IS CONNECTED TO TWO OTHER MACHINE.THIS KIND OF NETWORK IS ALSO EASY TO INSTALL
BUT A FAILURE IN ANY CABLE OR NODE CAN DISRUPT THE ENTIRE NETWORK<BR><BR>
<HR>

<H4><HEAD>BUS TOPOLOGY</HEAD></H4><IMG SRC="N.BMP" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER=3 HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=100>
IN BUS TOPOLOGY A SINGLE CABLE KNOWN AS THE BACKBONE OR BUS CARRIES ALL THE DATA.ALL THE COMPUTERS,PRINTERS,AND
OTHER PERIPHERALS WHICH ARE BEING SHARED ARE CONNECTED TO THE BUS.THIS KIND OF TOPOLOGY ARE NORMALLY USED FOR SMALL
NETWORKS.THE AMOUNT OF CABLING REQUIRED IS LESS,BUT THE ENTIRE NETWORK IS DEPENDENT ON THE BUS BACKBONE.<BR><BR>
<HR>

<H4><HEAD>MESH TOPOLOGY</HEAD></H4><IMG SRC="M.BMP" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER=3 HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=100>
IN MESH TOPOLOGY,EVERY NODE ON THE NETWORKIS CONNECTED TO ALL THE OTHER NODES ON THE NETWORK WHICH MAKES IT A VERY STABLE NETWORK.HOWEVER THE AMOUNT OF CABLING REQUIRED IS VERY LARGE.<BR><BR><BR><BR>
<HR>

<H4><HEAD>TREE TOPOLOGY</HEAD></H4><IMG SRC="P.BMP" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER=3 HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=100>
IN TREE TOPOLOGY NETWORK COMBINES THE CHARACTERISTICS OF BUS AND STAR NETWORKS.GROUPS OF STAR TOPOLOGY NETWORKS ARE  FORMED WHICH ARE THEN CONNECTED TO A BUS TOPOLOGY NETWORKS ARE FORMED WHICH ARE THEN CONNECTED TO A BUS BACKBONE CABLE.THIS KIND OF NETWORK ALLOWS FOR EASY EXPANSION OF AN EXISTING NETWORK,BUT IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO CONFIGURE AND WIRE.<BR><BR>
